# tumblr-likes

### A command-line program for downloading liked posts from Tumblr.

Very similar to a [Node.js package I created](https://github.com/subnomo/tumblr-like-dl) a few years ago. I noticed it was getting an surge of installs recently, most likely because [Tumblr decided to ban adult content](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode). That package doesn't work anymore though, so I rewrote it in Rust.
